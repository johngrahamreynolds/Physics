# Solutions
In my free time, I enjoy continuing my graduate-level physics education. In a calculated capacity, balancing breadth and depth, I read highly-prasied and community standard texts while solving (and validating solutions to) as many problems in them as I can to solidy my knowledge of the material. 

This folder houses latexed versions of selected solutions for my problem solving *since April 2022*. In more "formal" settings I have solved lots of exercises in the regimes of general relativity and semi-classical quantum gravity. While I hope to revisit this work eventually, I have priortized collecting here my most recent work on subjects with which I do not yet have a complete background.   


## Folders within include:

- [Quantum Field Theory Solutions]()
  - I have read through and solved problems from the listed sections of:
    
    *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model*, the [book](https://schwartzqft.fas.harvard.edu/) by Matthew D. Schwartz (Harvard): Ch.1 - Ch. 10
      
     - A fully powered book on QFT, originating from the Harvard QFT lecture notes.
    
    *QFT Lectures Notes*, the [lecture notes](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2016/05/QFTNotes.pdf) by Jared Kaplan (Johns Hopkins): 
    Sections 1.1 - 2.19, Problem Sheets 1 - 4
    
      - Lecture notes and problems supporting a course based on the text above taught at JHU by J. Kaplan in 2016. 
    
    *Quantum Field Theory*, the [lecture notes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html) by David Tong (Cambridge): Problem Sheets 1, 2
      
      - Lecture notes and problems for the Mathematical Tripos III QFT course at Cambridge taught by D. Tong.
 
- [Strings, Mathematical Physics]()
  - I have read through the listed sections and solved problems from:
  
    *Geometry of String Theory Compactifications*, the [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/geometry-of-string-theory-compactifications/F65178AB15B1CCAAD7645BBF221E17B4) 
    by Alessandro Tomasiello (Milano-Bicocca): Ch. 2
    
    - While this 2022 text is focused primarily on the machinery required for contemporary geometric study in string theory, it has fantastic mathetmatical depth (Ch. 2 - Ch. 7) on relevant topics across all of high energy theory (spinors, forms, differential geometry, and more).
  
    *A First Course in String Theory*, the [book](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/theoretical-physics-and-mathematical-physics/first-course-string-theory-2nd-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521880329)
    by Barton Zwiebach (MIT): Ch.1 - Ch. 3
    
    - An modestly sophisticated introduction to String Theory, based on a course taught to upper-level undergraduates at MIT.
