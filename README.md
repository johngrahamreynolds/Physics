# Physics
This folder houses typed versions of my writing, problem solving, research, study, etc. on all things physics related. The vast majority of my solutions and notes are written by hand, but I plan to gradually type them and post them here. 

This folder also houses an overview of my experience and various contributions in the field.


## Folders within include:

- [Research](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Research) - an overview of research I've conducted

  - [CLASS Telescope](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Research/CLASSTelescope)
  - [Black Holes, Firewalls, the Information Paradox](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Research/BlackHoles)
- [Solutions](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Solutions) - solutions to problems I've worked through
  - [Quantum Field Theory](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Solutions/QuantumFieldTheory)
  - [Strings, Mathematical Physics](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Solutions/Strings%2CMathematicalPhysics)
- [MathematicaSource](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/MathematicaSource)
  - Source code for mathematica template files I created to aid in solving highly coupled non-linear PDEs (Einstein Field Equation, Affine Connection coefficients, etc.)
- [QuantumGravity](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/QuantumGravity) - notes pertaining to QG
- [Writings](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Writings) - miscellaneous writings
