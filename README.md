# Physics
- This repo houses typed versions of my writing, problem solving, research, study, etc. on all things physics related. The vast majority of my notes are written by hand, but I plan to gradually type them and post them here.

- [Solutions](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Solutions)
- [QuantumGravity](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/QuantumGravity)
