# Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) Research

#### CLASS is a four telescope array designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in order to characterize relic primordial gravitational waves corresponding to cosmic inflation and the optical depth to reionization.

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as an undergraduate researcher on the [CLASS telescope](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) 
([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_Large_Angular_Scale_Surveyor#:~:text=The%20Cosmology%20Large%20Angular%20Scale,the%20Parque%20Astron%C3%B3mico%20de%20Atacama.)) 
on a multitude of sub-projects.

- Summer 2018 

  I was awarded a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Summer Teaching and Research (BDP STAR) stipend to fund my research over the 
summer at Hopkins working on CLASS. I spent the summer researching, developing, and testing the cryogenic receivers for the 90 GHz receiver, with the 
receiver focal plane reaching sub-50mK temperatures. 

  At the end of summer, I presented this work as a large [poster](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/blob/main/Research/CLASSTelescope/90GHzReceiverPoster.pdf) at the 
  [2018 Hopkins C.A.R.E.S. Symposium]()(listed at #7) for 
undergraduate research.
