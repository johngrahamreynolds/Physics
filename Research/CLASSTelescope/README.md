# Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) Research


### CLASS is a four telescope array designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in order to characterize relic primordial gravitational waves corresponding to cosmic inflation and the optical depth to reionization.

Under the direction of Co-PIs Toby Marriage and Chuck Bennett, various postdocs, and astronomy engineers, I spent nearly 2 years researching and developing this telescope system to study cosmology.

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as an undergraduate researcher on the [CLASS telescope](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) 
([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_Large_Angular_Scale_Surveyor#:~:text=The%20Cosmology%20Large%20Angular%20Scale,the%20Parque%20Astron%C3%B3mico%20de%20Atacama.)) 
on a multitude of sub-projects.

- September 2017 - Summer 2018
  
  Adjacent to coursework in Physics and Math, I helped construct the telescope system's second mount base, wiring, platform, and receiver cage. Work consisted of regular time spent engineering wiring, metal parts, and computers on the telescope platform. Returned to campus during the January term to help suport continued development.

- Summer 2018 

  I was awarded a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Summer Teaching and Research (BDP STAR) stipend by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Chuck Bennett to fund my research over the 
summer at Hopkins working on CLASS. I spent the summer researching, developing, and testing the cryogenic receivers for the 90 GHz receiver, with the 
receiver focal plane reaching sub-50mK temperatures.
  During this summer I took a cosmology course to supplement my knowledge of the theory behind the system's purpose.

  At the end of summer, I presented my work as a [large poster](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/blob/main/Research/CLASSTelescope/90GHzReceiverPoster.pdf) at the 
  [2018 Hopkins C.A.R.E.S. Symposium](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/blob/main/Research/CLASSTelescope/2018%20Hopkins%20CARES%20Poster%20Schedule.pdf) (poster #7) for 
undergraduate research. 

- September 2018 - December 2018

  Continued telescope analysis and development in a variety of manners: focal planes, cryostats, hardware. I helped to disassmble and package the second mount, receiver cage, and cryostat receivers into a shipping container to be sailed to northern Chile, and hence hauled to the observation site.
  
- January 2019
  
  I flew to Chile with lead project engineer to help unpack and assemble the telescope at its observation site in the Atacama Desert. The observation site for the telescope system is atop [Cerro Toco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Toco), a stratovolcano in Antofogasta, Chile, 
at approximately 17000ft, ~5200m.
