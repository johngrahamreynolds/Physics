# Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) Research

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as an undergraduate researcher on the [CLASS telescope](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) 
([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_Large_Angular_Scale_Surveyor#:~:text=The%20Cosmology%20Large%20Angular%20Scale,the%20Parque%20Astron%C3%B3mico%20de%20Atacama.)) 
on a multitude of sub-projects.

- Summer 2018 

  I was awarded a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Summer Teaching and Research (BDP STAR) stipend to fund my research over the 
summer at Hopkins working on CLASS. I spent the summer researching, developing, and testing the cryogenic receivers for the 90 GHz receiver, with the 
receiver focal plane reaching sub-50mK temperatures. 

  At the end of summer, I presented this work as a large [poster] at the 2018 Hopkins C.A.R.E.S. Symposium for 
undergraduate research.
