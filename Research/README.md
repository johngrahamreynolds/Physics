# Research

This folder houses relevant research projects that I have contributed to.

- [CLASS](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Research/CLASSTelescope)
  - A four telescope array designed, tested, and built at Johns Hopkins. After completion of simulation, the various telescope components are sailed to 
  the system's proper observation site in Antofagasta, Chile. I contributed to research on this project in a multitude of ways over an extended period of 
  time. 

- [Black Holes, General Relativity](https://github.com/johngrahamreynolds/Physics/tree/main/Research/BlackHoles)
  - Research I did in General Relativity and Semi-Classical Gravity on black holes and their corresponding information paradox.
